# NBrowser

I love Neovim, I love Browser. How can I combine these two. That it, I want to create a simple browser that has the same shortcut like Neovim and abilities to configure by Lua.

## What I have done so far

Not much, I just have created simple browser based on [this](https://pythonprogramminglanguage.com/webkit-browser/) in ```PyQt```

## Todo

- [x] Change close icon in tab
- [ ] Add tab switcher
- [ ] Add javascript's console as terminal
- [x] Add shortcut
- [x] Play video
- [ ] Show tabs in window's title

## FAQ

### Why not Qt?

I'm not really good at C so I choose Python to start.
